              It is a known fact that criminals often target religious
              organizations for various crimes. Such criminals believe that the
              sacred places are weak and vulnerable. Churches, synagogues,
              mosques, temples, and other places of worship face criminal
              activities like robbery, vandalism, violence, and terrorism.
              Recent statistics highlight over 1,900 anti-Semitic cases in the
              United States. The open nature of worship places makes them
              challenging to secure, potentially attracting individuals with
              harmful intentions.
