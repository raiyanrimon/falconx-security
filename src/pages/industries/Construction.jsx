              The world is developing at a rapid pace, with flourishing
              economies and numerous ongoing construction projects. These
              projects involve the use of expensive materials, equipment, and
              other valuable assets, making them vulnerable to theft or
              vandalism, particularly during nighttime. The unrestricted access
              to construction sites, with contractors, workers, and delivery
              agents constantly entering and exiting, poses a significant
              security challenge.

              Construction sites in California are highly vulnerable. In 2022,
              approximately 11,951 burglaries occurred in the United States,
              with construction sites accounting for a significant portion,
              resulting in an estimated $500 million worth of equipment stolen
              annually.
