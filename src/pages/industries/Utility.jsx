              Why Utility Agency Security is Important?
            </h1>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              In California, ensuring the security of utility agencies holds
              immense importance due to the critical role they play in
              sustaining everyday life and fostering economic development. As
              the most populous state in the US and holding the eighth-largest
              global economy, California faces significant demand for
              electricity. Any disruption in utility services, whether due to
              physical threats, natural disasters, or cyberattacks, can have
              severe consequences for the state’s residents and economy.
