              A logistics center is a dedicated facility for various operations
              like warehousing and freight forwarding. It ensures an efficient
              flow of goods, services, and related information. Logistic centers
              have possibilities of theft, burglary, and criminal attacks.
              Owners seek reliable security guard services for protection to
              minimize the risk of such mishaps in logistic centers.

              Logistics centers, with their intricate layouts and constant

              security guard company in California. FalconX Security Services
              manages all activities happening in the facility and prohibits
              access by unauthorized individuals, products, and consignments
