              Any public building’s reception and lobby areas shape the first
              impression of the entire facility. If the respective areas appear
              disorganized, chaotic, and disturbed, this can create a negative
              image of the lobby. As a result, management should take every
              precaution to keep unwanted visitors away from the reception and
              lobby areas. The presence of highly professional and well-trained
              security guards is highly beneficial in ensuring the safety of the
              lobby.
