              Why Vacant Properties Security is Important?
            </h1>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Vacant property security is crucial due to rising incidents of
              vandalism, theft, and trespassing. According to the FBI’s Uniform
              Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, California reported over 100,000
              cases of property crime in 2020 alone. Vacant properties are
              particularly vulnerable targets for criminals looking to exploit
              unattended premises. These crimes not only result in financial
              losses but also pose safety risks to neighboring communities.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Moreover, vacant properties can attract squatters and illicit
              activities, intensifying security concerns. According to a report
              by the California Department of Justice, the number of trespassing
              incidents in vacant properties has been on the rise in recent
              years.
