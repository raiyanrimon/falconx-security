              Homeowners Association (HOA) communities have increasingly become
              targets for criminals and burglars due to the busy lifestyles of
              homeowners, who often spend the majority of their time away from
              home. This absence during the day leaves properties vulnerable to
              potential threats. When criminals perceive lax security measures
              within your HOA, it makes these communities easy targets for
              repeated offenses.
