              rides, enchanting attractions, and magical experiences. From
              Disneyland Resort in Anaheim to Universal Studios Hollywood in Los

              Youngsters find thrills and excitement in adrenaline-pumping rides
              and immersive attractions, while adults revel in nostalgic

              Why Theme Parks Security is Important?
            </h1>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Theme parks in California attract millions of visitors annually,
              making safety a top priority. According to the FBI, the state
              reported over 1.2 million property crimes and 168,240 violent
              crimes in 2020, underscoring the need for robust security
              measures. As per the data revealed by the California Department of
              Justice, there were over 500 reported incidents of theft, assault,
              and vandalism in theme parks across the state last year alone.
              Additionally, theme parks can be targets for terrorism and other
              security threats due to their high visibility and symbolic value.
