              Cemeteries are not immune to security threats, yet often
              overlooked in terms of protection. These places are vulnerable to
              various risks, including theft and vandalism. As public spaces,
              cemeteries are open to visitors, making memorials, headstones, and
              other valuable items susceptible to criminal activity.

            <p className=" text-gray-800 my-3 text-justify leading-[27px]">
              In recent times, there has been an alarming trend of theft
              targeting bronze name plaques in cemeteries. These plaques, often
              affixed to memorials and headstones, hold sentimental value for
              families and are targeted for their material worth. This growing
              concern highlights the need for enhanced security measures to
              safeguard not only physical assets but also the emotional
              well-being of grieving families.

              Funerals and cemetery events may require additional security
              measures to ensure the safety of attendees and preserve the
              solemnity of the occasion. Trained security guards with expertise
              in cemetery security can handle such scenarios responsibly,
